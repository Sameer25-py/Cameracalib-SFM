Unlike shown in the lecture slides here you are required to choose an appropriate 3D calibration object (i.e. a nonplanar object, a rubiks cube for example) so that the world points on that object span a 3-dimensional space, and the image points are easy to mark. Place the calibration object on a horizontal plane, such as a tabletop, or floor, to take the image. Mark at least 20 image points as carefully as possible and establish their world coordinates in millimeters. \n",
